# Accelerometry-sensor-collection 
Records accelerometry data in a CSV file for information extraction.

Developed for my Master's Thesis: "A Mobile Application to Improve the Quality of Life via Exercise and Rehabilitation".

Records accelerometry data in a CSV file for information extraction.

A sensor calibration is required prior to usage.

The collected datasets are used for activity recognition through machine learning and energy expenditure estimation.

User information is also sent for the energy expenditure calculations in JSON format.

A custom server address can be specified in the options.
